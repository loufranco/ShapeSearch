    Abstract:
    This page shows how to write the code to find the best question to ask.
*/
//#-end-hidden-code
/*:
 When you start out with 16 shapes, the best question to ask is one where half of
 them have the attribute and half don't. So, no matter what the answer is, you will eliminate
 eight shapes. If you picked one that wasn't balanced, you could get lucky and eliminate more
 than eight, but if you don't, then you'll need more than four questions to find the shape.
 
 On this page, in order to find the best attribute, we need to count how many shapes have each one.
 The function `countAttributes()` is almost complete. Follow the comments in it to finish implementing the function.
